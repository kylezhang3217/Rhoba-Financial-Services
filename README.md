# Rhoba-Financial-Services

In this internship, I helped streamline Rhoba's financial analysis process by writing an R script that automates P&L statement creation. 

More specifically, the script gathers the requested time period's financial data from the main database, generates a P&L statement, and computes KPIs that Rhoba is most familiar with. 

"getRhProfit.r" is the source code for the R script. 

"getRhProfit_Examples" is a pdf showing examples of the script in action.
